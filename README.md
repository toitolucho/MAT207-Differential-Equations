# MAT207-Differential-Equations
 In this repository, I will add all the exercices for Differential Equations and python code to generate exercices for Moodle, I will include all the dataset and the project will be populated with Latex and python code

# 📘 Differential Equations Dataset & Book (MAT207)

This repository contains a **dataset of differential equations** and a **LaTeX-based book** on differential equations. The book is structured using **Mathcha.io** documents and compiled with **LaTeX** into a well-organized guide for students and professionals.
